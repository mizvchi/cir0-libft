# Circle 0 - libft

### Grade: ✅ [125 / 100]

---

## Description

The `libft` library is a collection of custom C functions, mimicking some of the real libc functions.

The project contains 2 parts:

- Mandatory part
- Bonus part

> _**NOTE:** As of <u>December 8, 2025</u>, the Libft no longer includes a Bonus section;_
> _The old bonus functions (linked lists) are now MANDATORY._
> _This repository is therefore obsolete, given the modification of the common core._
>
> _I plan to create a new repository shortly, taking into account the changes made to the Libft subject._


## Instructions

First, run `make` to create the `libft.a` library and/or `make bonus` to also compile the bonus functions.

Then, uncomment the main of the function you want to test.

Now you can run `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_<function_to_test>.c libft.a` to test the function with its main.


To clean the object files and library, run `make clean` and `make fclean` respectively.

The library is accompanied by a header file called `libft.h`, which contains prototypes for all the functions in the library.
